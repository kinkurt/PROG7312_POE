Note:
I have noticed that some files werent uploaded to github like the Textfiles so I did add them manually, hopefully it did add to help the program run smoothly otherwise I have
uploaded the project onto teams in a winrar.

Fixes I made to TASK 1 and TASK 2
...................................//////...........................................
TASK 1 -
Fixed the scoreboard problem with not loading in descending order by adding a zero if the score was less than 10.
Added some OOP.

TASK 2 - 
Fixed the clear the form when the user is done with the questions.
I had comments maybe they werent informative enough but I added some more.


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

Let the file load.
Make sure the file has loaded correctly.
Click the start button at the top of the screen it has a green play button next to it.
Let the forms open up and load.
Select the game you would like to play.
In this case select the finding call numbers in options and click the Play button
Enter your username. Click the start button.
Try and beat the game.
The user has to select the option where they think the option is best related to the answer.
It is the Dewey Decimal call numbers that goes multilevel.
The user can go indefinately as long as you are selecting the correct answer.
The run will end when the user selects the wrong answer.
Their score and name will be added to the scoreboard.
This is my gamification for this project.
